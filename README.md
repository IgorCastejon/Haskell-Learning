# Haskell-Learning

Some of the code that I've written while learning Haskell, mainly using GHCI. Because of that, it's not optimized (Integer vs Int, String, lists, space leaks and so on), well-documented and not a testament of my programming skills or current Haskell expertise.

Some code is from Learn You A Haskell (LYAH, the fork version - https://github.com/learnyouahaskell/learnyouahaskell.github.io), either from me doing some of the examples or exploring some of the topics. I also did exercises from Project Euler and LeetCode. There's also code from personal projects/interests.

In particular, qoi.hs is an in-progress project to implement a [QOI](https://qoiformat.org/) image encoder/decoder using TDD (type-driven development and test-driven development). I plan to eventually publish it as a series of blog posts when I can come back to it.
